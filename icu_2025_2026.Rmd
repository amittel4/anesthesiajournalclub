title: "Critical Care Medicine"
---

# 2025 - 2026

Journal club activities will be held on Wednesday afternoons throughout the Academic Year (August 1, 2025 through July 30, 2026). These will be ~90 minute sessions structured as outlined below. We will take a break between "EBM" and "Deep Dive" components, time permitting.

All sessions held in Presbyterian Hospital 5th Floor Sim Center Conference Room unless otherwise noted.

<br>

**EBM Review (45 min)**: review of papers that form the evidence base for our specialty.

<br>
_During EBM review, fellows will present assigned articles to the group. Fellows are expected to read ALL papers before each session. However, one fellow will "present" the paper in 5-6 min, with focus on broad reasons for the study, major methodologic points, abbreviated results, and potential to guide clinical practice._

<br>
**Deep Dive (30 min)**: detailed inspection of very recent paper with POTENTIAL to change future practice.

<br>
_During "Deep Dive", fellow and faculty will collectively discuss 1-2 articles in significant detail. This portion of journal club will focus on nuances of study design, including data analysis and interpretation of results. The goal of "Deep Dive" is to build fellows' skills for future study interpretation (i.e. beyond fellowship)._
