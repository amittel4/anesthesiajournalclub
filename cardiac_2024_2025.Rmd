[PROTECTION - RCT Amino Acids for AKI in Cardiac Surgery; NEJM 2024](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2403769)

* __Clinical Question__: In elective cardiac surgeries requiring CPB, does an IV infusion of amino acids (isopuramin 10%) therapy at the time of surgery compared to placebo (LR) decrease the incidence of postoperative AKI in the first week?

* __Methods + Results__: Multicenter RCT; The investigators measured baseline creatinine and defined a reasonable primary outcome, postoperative (0-7 days) AKI by KDIGO criteria. AKI had developed in 474 patients in the amino acid group (26.9%) and in 555 patients in the placebo group (31.7%) (RR = 0.85; 95% CI [0.77 to 0.94]; P=0.002). There were no differences in secondary outcome measures (Hospital and ICU LOS, RRT initiation, MV duration).

* __Take Away__: IV amino acids may reduce the risk of AKI after elective cardiac surgery. The study was well-designed and executed, but had limitations in patient demographics (external generalizability) and lack of additional indicators of AKI.

[ATACAS RCT: Stopping vs. Continuing Aspirin before Coronary Artery Surgery; NEJM 2016](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1507688)

* __Clinical Question__: Does taking aspirin before coronary artery bypass surgery reduce the risk of death or thrombotic complications (nonfatal myocardial infarction, stroke, pulmonary embolism, renal failure, or bowel infarction)?

* __Methods + Results__: After patients were randomized to aspirin or placebo and monitored for 30 days post coronary artery bypass surgery, the data showed that there were no significant differences in the primary outcome (death or thrombotic events) or secondary outcomes (death, myocardial infarction, renal failure, pulmonary embolism, bowel infarction, re-op for hemorrhage, cardiac tamponade).

* __Take Away__: Aspirin is safe to use in the perioperative period of coronary artery bypass surgery.
